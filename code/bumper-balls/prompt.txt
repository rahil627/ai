Creating a prototype version of the Bumper Balls mini game from the Mario Party series involves simulating a physics-based environment where players control ball-like characters and attempt to bump each other off the platform. I'll outline how you could achieve this using Unity and C#.

1. **Setting Up the Project:**
   - Create a new 2D Unity project.
   - Set up the necessary folders and import sprites for the player characters and the game environment.

2. **Scene Setup:**
   - Create a flat platform as the game arena.
   - Add four ball-like player characters to the platform.

3. **PlayerController Script:**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;

   public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour {
       public float moveSpeed = 5f;
       private Rigidbody2D rb;

       private void Start() {
           rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
       }

       private void Update() {
           float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
           float verticalInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
           Vector2 moveDirection = new Vector2(horizontalInput, verticalInput);
           rb.velocity = moveDirection * moveSpeed;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **PlayerCollision Script:**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;

   public class PlayerCollision : MonoBehaviour {
       private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision) {
           if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Player")) {
               // Push both players away from each other
               Rigidbody2D otherRB = collision.gameObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
               Vector2 awayDirection = (otherRB.position - GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().position).normalized;
               otherRB.AddForce(awayDirection * 10f, ForceMode2D.Impulse);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. **GameManager Script:**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

   public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour {
       public GameObject playerPrefab;
       public Transform[] spawnPoints;
       public int lives = 3;

       private void Start() {
           SpawnPlayers();
       }

       private void SpawnPlayers() {
           for (int i = 0; i < spawnPoints.Length; i++) {
               GameObject player = Instantiate(playerPrefab, spawnPoints[i].position, Quaternion.identity);
               player.GetComponent<PlayerController>().moveSpeed = Random.Range(3f, 6f);
           }
       }

       public void PlayerDied() {
           lives--;
           if (lives <= 0) {
               // End the game or restart the scene
               SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name);
           }
           else {
               // Respawn players
               SpawnPlayers();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

6. **UIManager Script:**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   using UnityEngine.UI;

   public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour {
       public Text livesText;

       private void Update() {
           livesText.text = "Lives: " + FindObjectOfType<GameManager>().lives;
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Player Falling Check Script:**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;

   public class PlayerFallingCheck : MonoBehaviour {
       private void Update() {
           if (transform.position.y < -10f) {
               FindObjectOfType<GameManager>().PlayerDied();
               Destroy(gameObject);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

8. **Input:**
   - Set up the Unity Input Manager to define "Horizontal" and "Vertical" axes for player movement.

9. **Canvas Setup:**
   - Create a Canvas and UI elements to display player lives and other relevant information.
   - Attach the `UIManager` script to update the UI.

10. **Prefab Setup:**
    - Create a prefab for the player character with the `PlayerController`, `PlayerCollision`, and `PlayerFallingCheck` scripts attached.

11. **Tag and Layer Setup:**
    - Tag the player character GameObjects as "Player".
    - Set up a "Player" layer for collision interactions.

12. **Build Settings:**
    - Add the current scene to the build settings.

13. **Testing:**
    - Play the game and test the prototype. Players should be able to control their characters using keyboard inputs, and collisions should push players away from each other. Falling off the platform should deduct lives and respawn players.

Remember, this is a simplified prototype and doesn't include all the features and polish of the original Bumper Balls mini game. You can expand upon this prototype by adding more power-ups, unique player abilities, fancier graphics, and refining the gameplay mechanics to match the Mario Party experience.
