just some notes:
pure js is just fine (server.js), i guess you'd install node.js for server-side handling?
ruby/sinatra is just prettier (app.rb), and if you've got that installed server-side, can avoid node.js ;)
  - probably my fav simple solution, but still have to deal with a front-end, likely pure js/css
  - todo: compare to pure ruby
x/elixir is compact, with a strict MVC file structure, def a learning curve for functional programming

for bigger apps can throw in flutter or react
flutter feels more systems programmingy (lots of ugly nesting), probably with better debugging too, and hot re-load for mobile
react actually has the most sensible output and also one file
  - what's the overhead? overkill?
